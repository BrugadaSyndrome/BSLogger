# BSLogger

This logger was designed to standardize how logs are written across multiple projects.

### Features
- ANSI Encoding
- Write logs to the terminal and to an output file at the same time
  - This is great for logging programs that run for an extended period of time
- The verbosity level can be set to control which log functions produce output without having to remove the function calls from code
